# Advanced_Data_Analysis_Nanodegree

We are working on this dataset:
https://data.sfgov.org/Health-and-Social-Services/Restaurant-Scores-LIVES-Standard/pyih-qa8i/data

The San Francisco Dept. of Public Healthâ€™s database of businesses, inspections of those businesses, and violations found during the inspections. Per the latter, we have 3 tables for each entity: 
Businesses
Inspections
Violations
We need to apply the data analysis process to our dataset and extract intriguing insights.
